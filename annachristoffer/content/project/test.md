Two main intentions been followed to create my digital portfolio. Firstly, the viewer should quickly see an overview of my work. Secondly, I wanted to overcome the design challenges involved in creating a responsive layout, so the site performs well on all devices.

Instead of showing an overview of pictures, each project is simple represented by a card with a title and a short description. As the result the focus is first on the text information. When the user hovers the mouse over the card, it flips to reveal the thumbnail image.

For navigation, a menu appears on the right hand side of the screen and is always visible on tablets and desktop computers, even by scrolling down the page it sticks to itâ€™s position. The user has easy access to the overview page, the about page and any project category filters.

Further to this, there is also two buttons present to allow the user to quickly and easily switch languages, along with a series of buttons allowing the user to share the site on social media networks.
