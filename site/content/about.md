## Text
The section element is for containing distinct different areas of functionality or subjects area, or breaking an article or story up into different sections. So in this case: "sidebar1" contains various useful links that will persist on every page of the site, such as "subscribe to RSS" and "Buy music from store". "main" contains the main content of this page, which is blog posts. On other pages of the site, this content will change. It is a fairly generic element, but still has way more semantic meaning than the plain old div.

This is another paragraph of text and we will see how it looks?
